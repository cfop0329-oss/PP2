print("Python is fun!")
'''
In Python, a statement usually ends when the line ends. You do not need to use a semicolon (;)
like in many other programming languages (for example, Java or C).
'''
print("Hello"); print("How are you?"); print("Bye bye!") 
'''
Semicolons are optional in Python. You can write multiple statements on one line by 
separating them with ; but this is rarely used because it makes it hard to read
